\section{A script to build a \LaTeX\ document while hiding auxiliary files}

%  \lstset{basicstyle = \ttfamily, language = bash}


\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,basicstyle=\ttfamily]
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Project name: " project #Take file name as input
if [ ! -d "./.build" ]; then     #If the folder .build doesn't exist,
	mkdir ./.build           #create a new folder.
fi
pdflatex $project.tex            #Compile the LaTeX file.
mv $project*.aux ./.build        #Move any aux files to .build folder.       
\end{lstlisting}

The first way the above code may fail is if the user inputs a name that doesn't match the original file exactly, i.e. the cases don't match. The second way the code may fail is if the LaTeX file is not located in the same directory as the shell script.
